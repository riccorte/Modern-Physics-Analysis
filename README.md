# Advanced Theoretical Physics Projects

This repository collects a set of advanced projects and presentations developed during my studies in **Theoretical and Quantum Physics**.  
Each project focuses on a specific conceptual or experimental aspect of modern physics, ranging from **quantum optics** and **measurement theory** to **quantum information and atomic systems**.

## Repository Structure

- **/angular_momentum_of_photons/**  
  Study and critical overview of **Richard Beth’s historical experiment** (1936) on the **angular momentum of light**.  
  Includes a theoretical analysis of how circularly polarized photons carry **quantized spin angular momentum (ℏ per photon)**, as well as a modern interpretation in the framework of **quantum electrodynamics (QED)**.  
  The report revisits the experimental setup, torque measurements, and implications for photon spin and polarization in contemporary optics.

- **/quantum_zeno_effect/**  
  A short **presentation project** exploring the **Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE)** — the phenomenon by which frequent measurement can inhibit the evolution of a quantum system.  
  The presentation outlines:
  - The mathematical derivation of the QZE from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation  
  - The connection between measurement-induced projection and system freezing  
  - Experimental realizations and conceptual implications for **quantum control** and **decoherence theory**  

- **/quantum_information_lithium_project/**  
  A research-oriented notebook and notes on a **quantum information** problem concerning the **approximation of the ground-state energy of the lithium atom**.  
  The project explores how **variational and perturbative methods** can be applied in a **quantum computing framework**, with particular reference to:
  - Simplified Hamiltonian representations  
  - Spin–orbital coupling approximations  
  - Trial wavefunctions and numerical optimization of parameters  
  The goal is to bridge **traditional atomic physics** approaches with emerging **quantum simulation techniques**.

## Background

These projects were completed as part of advanced coursework and self-driven research in **theoretical and quantum physics**.  
They aim to deepen conceptual understanding of **quantum phenomena** through both **analytical derivations** and **computational modeling**.

Each project is independent and can be read or executed separately. The repository as a whole reflects a cohesive exploration of **quantum theory from different perspectives** — optical, informational, and foundational.
